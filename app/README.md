# App - Next.js

## Description
### This is the frontend of the application, where you would find the reports for the project.

### 1. Create a .env file in the root with the following variables (ask the owner of the repository for the values of the variables)
```bash
DB_NAME= 
DB_PASSWORD= 
DB_HOST= localhost
DB_PORT = 5432
DB_USER = postgres
```

### Note: For this project we are using postgres, but you can use any database you want, just change the values of the variables in the .env file. Also, we are using the Nextjs API routes to make endpoints, but you can use any framework you want.
